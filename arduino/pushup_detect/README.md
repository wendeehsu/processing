# Pushup Detection

## Materials
* button
* Arduino 33 ble sense rev2
> We utilize the board's proximity sensor

## How does it works
1. Tie the arduino in the user's chest (sensor facing outwards)
1. Press the button when ready
1. The user can start doing pushups
> When the distance between the floor and the user's chest is smaller than our defined threshold, the program will detect it as one pushup

serial port result for 4 pushups:
